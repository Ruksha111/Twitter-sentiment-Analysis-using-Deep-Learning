# Twitter-sentiment-Analysis-using-Deep-Learning

The sentiment analysis is performed on 1.6 million Twitter data using a deep learning approach that combines feature work with tweet words, word2vec, and stop words integrated with CNN and LSTM models.
Our proposed LSTM and CNN models achieved an accuracy of approximately 78.23% and 77.36%, respectively, on sentiment analysis for Twitter data.
